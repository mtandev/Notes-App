<h1 style ="bold">DAYS 1 & 2 of #100DaysOfCode</h1>

To kick off this challenge, I created a Notes App. 

With this app you can create new text notes and/or delete previously created notes. 

Features utilized:
<ul>
<li>Menu (to add a new note)</li>
<li>Shared Preferences (to store all created notes upon exiting the app)</li>
<li>Alert Dialog (to delete old notes)</li>
</ul>
